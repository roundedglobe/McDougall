McDougall has recently been revived by contemporary philosophers of science for articulating a pluralistic account of biological processes
which contends against mechanism and mind/body dualism

One of the central points of contention between the history and philosophy of science as well as between philosophers and sociologists of science
has been around the idea of the the intrinsic worth of ideas and the possibility of evaluative criteria 
Mary Hesse "Revolutions and Reconstructions in the Philosophy of Science" 1980 contributed to sophisticated considerations of
what she considered to be relativistic accounts of the origins of scientific knowledge
She ascribed these views to Thomas Kuhn, Willard V.O. Quine, and probably mistakenly to Paul Feyerabend
Feyerabend had very definite ideas about the origins of natural knowledge, relativism is not the way to describe them.
For Hesse and others, historians of science and relativists are confused. 
Explaining the social origins of scientific knowledge is laudable
However, philosophers as philosophers must attempt to evaluate historical explanations of the social and natural world, as they can not forget 
that "there is a history of philosophy- of the problems of empiricism and rationalism, realism and idealism- as well as a history of science.  
For philosophers of science, historical science is judged according two in Hesse's framework, two criteria: 
"increasingly successful prediction and hence the possibility of instrumental control of the external world" Introduction, xviii-xix
Contemporary philosophers of science, using similar reasoning, have begun to re-examine McDougall's psychology
especially his 1929 "Modern materialism and Emergent Evolution" for its arguments against materialism and reductionism as well as for its "pluralistic"
perspective.  
This all sounds wonderful: if McDougall says interesting and useful things about reductionism, then he should be read and studied. 
His pluralism should be vaulted- at the moment in the field it is "any pluralist in a storm"- but should his contributions to ideas,
the intrinsic value of his anti-materialist stance be adopted without question given his racism and eugenics?
This is a very good question
Also, not sure if any philosophers have really read McDougall, I only detail what is imputed to him. Will find out more of this.
